<h1> Orc - A miro MVC framework </h1>
Orc is a PHP based micro MVC framework with minimal driving content inside it.Most of the working concept of Orc is quit analoguous to <strong>CodeIgniter Web Framework</strong>. A basic layout is totally from [Kevin Waterson's MVC tutorial](http://www.phpro.org/tutorials/Model-View-Controller-MVC.html) and I'll try to discuss concept behind all new code in comments and documentation.

<h1>Docs</h1>
You can find docs here .However it is still under construction

<h1>MIT Lisence</h1>
Orc is under MIT Lisence so no worries use it according to your use.
<strong>Fork it!</strong>
